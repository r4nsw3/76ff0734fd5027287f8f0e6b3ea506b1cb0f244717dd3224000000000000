  |                                                                         |
  |   This little patch is to be used for the JPN/Asian release of the      |
  |   game (010002C00C270000) and will allow you to select all other        |
  |   languages from the US/EU version (the ones mentioned right up         |
  |   above). This will basically render the US/EU releases useless.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Once installed, in-game go to My Data / Options / Select Language     |
  |   and choose your favorite language.                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Also keep in mind that once you set your language, you can freely     |
  |   delete our patch, it will still save your language (which you would   |
  |   need to do if there is eventually an update for it one day).          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Install instructions: you need to unrar our release on the root       |
  |   of your SDCARD. Depending on your OS, it *could* overwrite existing   |
  |   sxos + atmosphere folders on your SDCARD, so make sure you merge      |
  |   it instead of overwriting it. If you are using exFAT, you might run   |
  |   into the "archive bit issue". Instructions to set it up depends on    |
  |   the OS. You can skip the following steps if your SD is formatted as   |
  |   FAT32.                                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   On Windows :                                                          |
  |   1. Select the sxos/atmosphere folders at the root of your SD card.    |
  |   2. Right click the items and select "Properties".                     |
  |   3. Select "Advanced...". Untick the "Folder is ready for archiving"   |
  |      checkbox, then click "OK".                                         |
  |   4. Click "Apply". When the confirmation dialog comes up, select:      |
  |      "Apply changes to this folder, subfolders and files", click "OK".  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   On UNIX/OSX based systems type these two commands on the terminal :   |
  |   sudo chflags -R arch /Volumes/YOURSDVOLUME/sxos                       |
  |   sudo chflags -R arch /Volumes/YOURSDVOLUME/atmosphere                 |
